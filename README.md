## description
 I wanted to create a version of a social networks back en to help futher my skills.
 With this project you can have your own private social network back end.
 In doing this project I gained a better understanding of mongodb, mongoose and futhered my comfort with routes and databases.

## Installation
  To install this program you will need to copy over the files. Do an npm install. Start up mongo to connect to the database by typing mongod into the terminal. You might need to start the mongo app and make sure it connects. After you are connected then type npm start into the terminal and you will see that you are connected. 

## usage
  Once you are connected using the steps above you can go into insomina and start using the routes to add users, add thoughts, add reactions. You can also updated and delete as well. The video link below shows a walk through of the app working and how to use the routes.
